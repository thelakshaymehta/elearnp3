Hi Rajesh,

I wanted to have a quick 1:1 because there are a few things I have been feeling lately, and I think it’s better to share with you directly.

I really respect the work you do and I’m learning a lot under your guidance, but at times I feel a bit demotivated because of how some of the feedback comes across. I wanted to clarify that I’m not asking for extra appreciation or recognition, but some comments — for example in the last retrospective call about the Star of the Spring nomination, or when very small things like message capitalization are pointed out — end up making me feel singled out.

There have also been times when I’ve taken up difficult stories that spilled over multiple sprints and delivered them, or helped during late-night production issues, but instead of feeling encouraged, I feel like my mistakes are magnified compared to others.

One major instance was when we spent months finalizing the module approach, groomed the story based on that, and just after grooming the approach changed. I requested time to analyze the new approach, but the estimate wasn’t adjusted. I struggled a lot to deliver it on time and had to work late nights, which was very stressful.

I’m sharing this because I want to perform my best, stay focused, and keep contributing positively to the team. I value your feedback, and if there’s anything I should do differently, I’m open to improving. But I also wanted to make you aware that some of these situations are impacting my motivation and confidence.

Do you think we could find a way to make feedback a bit more constructive so I can use it to improve without feeling discouraged?
