Subject: Work Report Submission and Reflection on Contributions

Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

As requested, I’ve attached my detailed work report outlining the user stories, subtasks, and associated story points I’ve worked on so far. The report covers both development and QA tasks that I’ve contributed to during my time on the project.

I would also like to respectfully share some context regarding the nature of my contributions.

When I joined the team as a fresher, I was eager to learn and support the project in any way I could. Based on the team’s evolving priorities and workload, I was assigned tasks in both development and QA. Over time, the volume of QA-related work increased, and I took initiative to support those needs to ensure timely and quality releases.

At the same time, I did work on several development stories — including some technically challenging ones — and I was fortunate to receive appreciation from Todd (our onsite team lead) for my efforts on those tasks. I’ve highlighted these items in the report for reference.

While my responsibilities were distributed across both roles, I’ve always tried to give my best and contribute meaningfully to the team. I understand that more consistent involvement in development would have helped me grow further, and I remain very eager to continue learning and contributing in that area.

Thank you for taking the time to review my report and for your continued guidance. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to be a part of this team and look forward to any feedback you may have.

Warm regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you’d like to add or remove anything — for example, if you want to include a specific story ID or the exact message from Todd, I can help fine-tune it.
