Hey team! ðŸ‘‹
Wanted to share a quick experience â€” I recently started using GitHub Copilot as a support tool during pre-grooming, and itâ€™s actually been quite helpful.

Before the grooming session, I used Copilot to quickly draft how the solution might look in code. It helped me visualize the logic early, spot a few edge cases, and get more confident about the complexity. Because of that, I was able to give a better estimate and explain my thought process more clearly during the discussion.

Later, when we picked up the story, I already had a rough direction to follow, so the development went faster and the fix was pretty straightforward.

Definitely recommend trying Copilot even before writing actual code â€” itâ€™s great for shaping up your initial thoughts. ðŸ’¡
