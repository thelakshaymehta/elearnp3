Understanding the SECURE 2.0 Act

‚∏ª

What is the SECURE Act?
The SECURE Act stands for ‚ÄúSetting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement.‚Äù It was first passed in 2019 to expand access to retirement savings and make it easier for workers and employers to participate in retirement plans.

‚∏ª

What is SECURE 2.0?
In December 2022, the SECURE 2.0 Act was introduced as an update to the original law. It brings new rules that encourage more saving, give employers greater flexibility, and provide individuals more control over how and when they use their retirement funds.

‚∏ª

Key Highlights of SECURE 2.0
	‚Ä¢	Automatic Enrollment (from 2025): New retirement plans must automatically enroll eligible employees, unless they choose to opt out.
	‚Ä¢	Bigger Catch-Up Contributions: Workers aged 60‚Äì63 will be able to make higher ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù contributions in addition to regular limits.
	‚Ä¢	Later Withdrawals: The age to begin Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) has increased to 73, and will rise to 75 in 2033. Penalties for missing RMDs have been reduced.
	‚Ä¢	Expanded Roth Options: Roth 401(k)s no longer require RMDs during the owner‚Äôs lifetime, and employers can also offer Roth matching contributions.
	‚Ä¢	Student Loan Support (from 2024): Employers may match student loan payments with retirement plan contributions.
	‚Ä¢	Saver‚Äôs Match (from 2027): A government match of up to $1,000 per year will be contributed directly into the retirement accounts of eligible lower-income workers.

In Summary
SECURE 2.0 builds on the original SECURE Act to create more opportunities for saving, more flexibility for employers, and more confidence for individuals as they plan for retirement.
