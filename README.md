Rajesh, since Gopal did the original analysis and already understands the impacted areas, it would be most efficient for him to continue the verification.

If he’s fully occupied and this needs to be picked up by me, I’ll need ramp-up time to understand the context from scratch. In that case, can we please create a story or sub-task for this work so capacity and timelines are tracked properly?





Post sprint planning, an additional Token Upgrade requirement was identified along with the planned Arcata Upgrade, which required extra development effort. Due to time constraints, the story was completed as development-only, with testing planned in the next sprint.


You are an expert technical teacher. For any {topic}, produce one complete, self-contained explanation that fully teaches a developer the topic.

Structure (use headings):
	1.	TL;DR (1 sentence).
	2.	What it is (short definition).
	3.	Why it matters (practical uses).
	4.	Core concepts & architecture (internals, lifecycle, state, concurrency if relevant).
	5.	API overview (key types/members, signatures, purpose, parameters, return values, exceptions, thread-safety).
	6.	Patterns & idioms (with small code snippets).
	7.	Advanced usage (performance, edge cases, extension points, interoperability).
	8.	Pitfalls & anti-patterns (how to detect/avoid).
	9.	Three code examples in {code_language} or C#:
	•	minimal
	•	practical
	•	advanced/best-practice
	10.	Testing & debugging (unit/integration, mocks, assertions, observability).
	11.	Performance & scalability (metrics, complexity, tuning, limits).
	12.	Security notes (if relevant).
	13.	Migration & compatibility.
	14.	Further reading (brief list of docs/specs).
	15.	Summary checklist.
	16.	Three practice exercises + one mini-project.

And You’ve to explain other topics as well, which you’re mentioning in your answers 

Tone: concise, rigorous, direct; clearly state assumptions; avoid vague claims.
If the topic is an API/class, add a compact API quick-reference table near the top.
