Hi [Manager’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. As you know, I worked overnight to resolve the pre-production issue yesterday and completed the required tasks to stabilize the environment.

I wanted to check with you regarding compensation for the extended hours.
Please let me know if I should apply for a comp off, or if this effort qualifies for overtime compensation as per our policy. I’m comfortable with whichever option aligns best with the team’s guidelines.

Kindly advise on how I should proceed.

Thank you for your support.
[Your Name]
